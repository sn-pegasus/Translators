who rests on grass of many hues.
and may he duly bring to me the six bound closely through these drops.
as one who ploughs with steers brings corn.
along their paths the mothers go sisters of priestly ministrants.
mingling their sweetness with the milk.
may waters gathered near the sun and those wherewith the sun is joined.
speed forth this sacrifice of ours.
i call the waters goddesses wherein our cattle quench their thirst.

continually for our share we come.
wealth highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it which is laid.
free from all hatred in thy hands.
through thy protection may we come to even the height of affluence.
which bhaga hath dealt out to us.
neer have those birds that fly through air attained to thy high dominion or thy might or spirit.
nor these the waters that flow on for ever nor hills abaters of the winds wild fury.
varuṇa king of hallowed might sustaineth erect the trees stem in the baseless region.
its rays whose root is high above stream downward deep may they sink within us and be hidden.
king varuṇa hath made a spacious pathway a pathway for the sun wherein to travel.
where no way was he made him set his footstep and warned afar whateer afflicts the spirit.
a hundred balms are thine o king a thousand deep and widereaching also be thy favours.
far from us far away drive thou destruction put from us een the sin we have committed.
whither by day depart the constellations that shine at night set high in heaven above us.
varuṇas holy laws remain unweakened and through the night the moon moves on in splendor.
i ask this of thee with my prayer adoring thy worshipper craves this with his oblation.
varuṇa stay thou here and be not angry steal not our life from us o thou wideruler.
nightly and daily this one thing they tell me this too the thought of mine own heart repeateth.
may he to whom prayed fettered Śunaḥśepa may he the sovran varuṇa release us.
bound to three pillars captured Śunaḥśepa thus to the Āditya made his supplication.
him may the sovran varuṇa deliver wise neer deceived loosen the bonds that bind him.
with bending down oblations sacrifices o varuṇa we deprecate thine anger.
wise asura thou king of wide dominion loosen the bonds of sins by us committed.
loosen the bonds o varuṇa that hold me loosen the bonds above between and under.
so in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to aditi o thou Āditya.
whatever law of thine o god o varuṇa as we are men.
day after day we violate.
give us not as a prey to death to be destroyed by thee in wrath.
to thy fierce anger when displeased.
to gain thy mercy varuṇa with hymns we bind thy heart as binds.
the charioteer his tethered horse.
they flee from me dispirited bent only on obtaining wealth.
as to their nests the birds of air.
when shall we bring to be appeased the hero lord of warrior might.
him the farseeing varuṇa.
this this with joy they both accept in common never do they fail.
the everfaithful worshipper.
he knows the path of birds that fly through heaven and sovran of the sea.
he knows the ships that are thereon.
true to his holy law he knows the twelve moons with their progeny.
he knows the moon of later birth.
he knows the pathway of the wind the spreading high and mighty wind.
he knows the gods who dwell above.
varuṇa true to holy law sits down among his people he.
most wise sits there to govern all.
from thence perceiving he beholds all wondrous things both what hath been.
and what hereafter will be done.
may that Āditya very wise make fair paths for us all our days.
may he prolong our lives for us.
varuṇa wearing golden mail hath clad him in a shining robe.
his spies are seated found about.
the god whom enemies threaten not nor those who tyrannize oer men.
nor those whose minds are bent on wrong.
he who gives glory to mankind not glory that is incomplete.
to our own bodies giving it.
yearning for the wideseeing one my thoughts move onward unto him.
as kine unto their pastures move.
once more together let us speak because my meath is brought priestlike.
thou eatest what is dear to thee.
now saw i him whom all may see i saw his car above the earth.
he hath accepted these my songs.
varuṇa hear this call of mine be gracious unto us this day.
longing for help i cried to thee.
thou o wise god art lord of all thou art the king of earth and heaven.
hear as thou goest on thy way.
release us from the upper bond untie the bond between and loose.
the bonds below that i may live.
o worthy of oblation lord of prospering powers assume thy robes.
and offer this our sacrifice.
sit ever to be chosen as our priest most youthful through our hymns.
o agni through our heavenly word.
for here a father for his son kinsman for kinsman worshippeth.
and friend choiceworthy for his friend.
here let the foedestroyers sit varuṇa mitra aryaman.
like men upon our sacred grass.
o ancient herald be thou glad in this our rite and fellowship.

i will declare the manly deeds of indra the first that he achieved the thunderwielder.
he slew the dragon then disclosed the waters and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents.
he slew the dragon lying on the mountain his heavenly bolt of thunder tvaṣṭar fashioned.
like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean.
impetuous as a bull he chose the soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices.
maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons.
when indra thou hadst slain the dragons firstborn and overcome the charms of the enchanters.
then giving life to sun and dawn and heaven thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee.
indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces vṛtra worst of vṛtras.
as trunks of trees what time the axe hath felled them low on the earth so lies the prostrate dragon.
he like a mad weak warrior challenged indra the great impetuous manyslaying hero.
he brooking not the clashing of the weapons crushedindras foethe shattered forts in falling.
footless and handless still he challenged indra who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders.
emasculate yet claiming manly vigour thus vṛtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered.
there as he lies like a bankbursting river the waters taking courage flow above him.
the dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which vṛtra with his greatness had encompassed.
then humbled was the strength of vṛtras mother indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her.
the mother was above the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay danu.
rolled in the midst of neverceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward.
the waters bear off vṛtras nameless body the foe of indra sank to during darkness.
guarded by ahi stood the thralls of dāsas the waters stayed like kine held by the robber.
but he when he had smitten vṛtra opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.
a horses tail wast thou when he o indra smote on thy bolt thou god without a second.
thou hast won back the kine hast won the soma thou hast let loose to flow the seven rivers.
nothing availed him lightning nothing thunder hailstorm or mist which had spread around him.
when indra and the dragon strove in battle maghavan gained the victory for ever.
whom sawest thou to avenge the dragon indra that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him.
that like a hawk affrighted through the regions thou crossedst nineandninety flowing rivers.
indra is king of all that moves and moves not of creatures tame and horned the thunderwielder.
over all living men he rules as sovran containing all as spokes within the felly.
come fain for booty let us seek to indra yet more shall he increase his care that guides us.
will not the indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth of cattle.
i fly to him invisible wealthgiver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie.
with fairest hymns of praise adoring indra whom those who laud him must invoke in battle.
mid all his host he bindeth on the quiver he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth.
gathering up great store of riches indra be thou no trafficker with us most mighty.
thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy dasyu alone yet going with thy helpers indra.
far from the floor of heaven in all directions the ancient riteless ones fled to destruction.
fighting with pious worshippers the riteless turned and fled indra with averted faces.
when thou fierce lord of the bay steeds the stayer blewest from earth and heaven and sky the godless.
they met in fight the army of the blameless then the navagvas put forth all their power.
they like emasculates with men contending fled conscious by steep paths from indra scattered.
whether they weep or laugh thou hast oerthrown them o indra on the skys extremest limit.
the dasyu thou hast burned from heaven and welcomed the prayer of him who pours the juice and lauds thee.
adorned with their array of gold and jewels they oer the earth a covering veil extended.
although they hastened they oercame not indra their spies he compassed with the sun of morning.
as thou enjoyest heaven and earth o indra on every side surrounded with thy greatness.
so thou with priests hast blown away the dasyu and those who worship not with those who worship.
they who pervaded earths extremest limit subdued not with their charms the wealthbestower.
indra the bull made his ally the thunder and with its light milked cows from out the darkness.
the waters flowed according to their nature he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty.
then indra with his spirit concentrated smote him for ever with his strongest weapon.
indra broke through ilībiśas strong castles and Śuṣṇa with his horn he cut to pieces.
thou maghavan for all his might and swiftness slewest thy fighting foeman with thy thunder.
fierce on his enemies fell indras weapon with his sharp bull he rent their forts in pieces.
he with his thunderbolt dealt blows on vṛtra and conquered executing all his purpose.
indra thou helpest kutsa whom thou lovedst and guardedst brave daśadyu when he battled.
the dust of trampling horses rose to heaven and Śvitrās son stood up again for conquest.
Śvitrās mild steer o maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land mid tugras houses.
long stood they there before the task was ended thou wast the master of the foemens treasure.

ayasya friend of all men hath engendered the fourth hymn as he sang his laud to indra.
thinking aright praising eternal order the sons of dyaus the asura those heroes.
aṅgirases holding the rank of sages first honoured sacrifices holy statute.
girt by his friends who cried with swanlike voices bursting the stony barriers of the prison.
bṛhaspati spake in thunder to the cattle and uttered praise and song when he had found them.
apart from one away from two above him he drave the kine that stood in bonds of falsehood.
bṛhaspati seeking light amid the darkness drave forth the bright cows three he made apparent.
when he had cleft the lairs and western castle he cut off three from him who held the waters.
bṛhaspati discovered while he thundered like dyaus the dawn the sun the cow the lightning.
as with a hand so with his roaring indra cleft vala through the guardian of the cattle.
seeking the milkdraught with sweatshining comrades he stole the paṇis kine and left him weeping.
he with bright faithful friends winners of booty hath rent the milker of the cows asunder.
bṛhaspati with wild boars strong and mighty sweating with heat hath gained a rich possession.
they longing for the kine with faithful spirit incited with their hymns the lord of cattle.
bṛhaspati freed the radiant cows with comrades selfyoked averting shame from one another.
in our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth like a lion.
maywe in every fight where heroes conquer rejoice in strong bṛhaspati the victor.
when he had won him every sort of booty and gone to heaven and its most lofty mansions.
men praised bṛhaspati the mighty bringing the light within their mouths from sundry places.
fulfil the prayer that begs for vital vigour aid in your wonted manner even the humble.
let all our foes be turned and driven backward hear this o heaven and earth ye allproducers.
indra with mighty strength cleft asunder the head of arbuda the watery monster.
slain ahi and set free the seven rivers o heaven and earth with all the gods protect us.
like birds who keep their watch plashing in water like the loud voices of the thundering raincloud.
like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to bṛhaspati our hymns have sounded.
the son of aṅgirases meeting the cattle as bhaga brought in aryaman among us.
as friend of men he decks the wife and husband as for the race bṛhaspati nerve our coursers.
bṛhaspati having won them from the mountains strewed down like barley out of winnowing baskets.
the vigorous wandering cows who aid the pious desired of all of blameless form wellcoloured.
as the sun dews with meath the seat of order and casts a flaming meteor down from heaven.
so from the rock bṛhaspati forced the cattle and cleft the earths skin as it were with water.
forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness as the gale blows a lily from the fiver.
like the wind grasping at the cloud of vala bṛhaspati gathered to himself the cattle.
bṛhaspati when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of reviling vala.
consumedḥim as tongues cat what teeth have compassed he threw the prisons of the red cows open.
that secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave bṛhaspati discovered.
and drave himself the bright kine from the mountain like a birds young after the eggs disclosure.
he looked around on rockimprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish in scanty water.
bṛhaspati cleaving through with varied clamour brought it forth like a bowl from out the timber.
he found the light of heaven and fire and morning with lucid rays he forced apart the darkness.
as from a joint bṛhaspati took the marrow of vala as he gloried in his cattle.
as trees for foliage robbed by winter vala mourned for the cows bṛhaspati had taken.
he did a deed neer done neer to be equalled whereby the sun and moon ascend alternate.
like a dark steed adorned with pearl the fathers have decorated heaven with constellations.

may the delight of gods spread out transversely may it be with us long in length and fragrant.
o holy grass divine with friendly spirit bring thou the willing gods whose chief is indra.

yearning ye doors with those sublime in greatness seize eagerly the heavenly car that cometh.

agni bring hither varuṇa to help us indra from heaven from airs midrealm the maruts.
on sacred grass all holy ones be seated and let the immortal gods rejoice in svāhā.
whenmen bṛhaspati giving names to objects sent out vāks first and earliest utterances.
all that was excellent and spotless treasured within them was disclosed through their affection.
where like men cleansing cornflour in a cribble the wise in spirit have created language.
friends see and recognize the marks of friendship their speech retains the blessed sign imprinted.
with sacrifice the trace of vāk they foilowed and found her harbouring within the Ṛṣis.
they brought her dealt her forth in many places seven singers make her tones resound in concert.
one man hath neer seen vāk and yet he seeth one man hath hearing but hath never heard her.
but to another hath she shown her beauty as a fond welldressed woman to her husband.
one man they call a laggard dull in friendship they never urge him on to deeds of valour.
he wanders on in profitless illusion the voice he heard yields neither fruitnor blossom.
no part in vāk hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who knows the truth of friendship.
even if he hears her still in vain he listens naught knows he of the path of righteous action.
unequal in the quickness of their spirit are friends endowed alike with eyes and hearing.
some look like tanks that reach the mouth or shoulder others like pools of water fit to bathe in.
when friendly brahmans sacrifice together with mental impulse which the heart hath fashioned.
they leave one far behind through their attainments and some who count as brahmans wander elsewhere.
those men who step not back and move not forward nor brahmans nor preparers of libations.
having attained to vāk in sinful fashion spin out their thread in ignorance like spinsters.
all friends are joyful in the friend who cometh in triumph having conquered in assembly.
he is their blameaverter foodprovider prepared is he and fit for deed of vigour.
one plies his constant task reciting verses one sings the holy psalm in sakvari measures.
one more the brahman tells the lore of being and one lays down the rules of sacrificing.
let us with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the gods.
that one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.
these brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting like a smith.
existence in an earlier age of gods from nonexistence sprang.
existence in the earliest age of gods from nonexistence sprang.
thereafter were the regions born this sprang from the productive power.
earth sprang from the productive power the regions from the earth were born.
dakṣa was born of aditi and aditi was dakṣas child.
for aditi o dakṣa she who is thy daughter was brought forth.
after her were the blessed gods born sharers of immortal life.
when ye o gods in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood.
thence as of dancers from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.
when o ye gods like yatis ye caused all existing things to grow.
then ye brought sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.
eight are the sons of adid who from her body sprang to life.
with seven she went to meet the gods she cast martanda far away.
so with her seven sons aditi went forth to meet the earlier age.
she brought martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.
i am prepared to laud with song or worship the noble ones who are in earth and heaven.
or coursers who have triumphed in the contest or those who famed have won the prize with glory.
their call the call of gods went up to heaven they kissed the ground with gloryseeking spirit.
there where the gods look on for happy fortune and like the kindly heavens bestow their bounties.
this is the song of those immortal beings who long for treasures in their full perfection.
may these completing prayers and sacrifices bestow upon us wealth where naught is wanting.
those living men extolled thy deed o indra those who would fain burst through the stall of cattle.
fain to milk her who bare but once great lofty whose sons are many and her streams past number.
sacivan win to your assistance indra who never bends who overcomes his foemen.
Ṛbhukṣan maghavan the hymns upholder who rich in food bears mans kind friend the thunder.
since he who won of old anew hath triumphed indra hath earned his name of vṛtraslaycr.
he hath appeared the mighty lord of conquest what we would have him do let him accomplish.
the singer o ye waters in vivasvāns place shall tell your grandeur forth that is beyond compare.
the rivers have come forward triply seven and seven sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flow.
varuṇa cut the channels for thy forward course o sindhu when thou rannest on to win the race.
thou speedest oer precipitous ridges of the earth when thou art lord and leader of these moving floods.
his roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light.
like floods of rain that fall in thunder from the cloud so sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull.
like mothers to their calves like milch kine with their milk so sindhu unto thee the roaring rivers run.
thou leadest as a warrior king thine armys wings what time thou comest in the van of these swift streams.
favour ye this my laud o gangā yamunā o sutudri paruṣṇī and sarasvatī.
with asikni vitasta o marudvrdha o Ārjīkīya with susoma hear my call.
first with trstama thou art eager to flow forth with rasā and susartu and with svetya here.
with kubha and with these sindhu and mehatnu thou seekest in thy course krumu and gomati.
flashing and whitelygleaming in her mightiness she moves along her ample volumes through the realms.
most active of the active sindhu unrestrained like to a dappled mare beautiful fair to see.
rich in good steeds is sindhu rich in cars and robes rich in gold noblyfashioned rich in ample wealth.
blest silamavati and young urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets.
sindhu hath yoked her car lightrolling drawn by steeds and with that car shall she win booty in this fight.
so have i praised its power mighty and unrestrained of independent glory roaring as it runs.
i grasp at you when power and strength begin to dawn bedew ye indra and the maruts heaven and earth.
that day and night in every hall of sacrifice may wait on us and bless us when they first spring forth.
press the libation out most excellent of all the pressingstone is grasped like a handguided steed.
so let it win the valour that subdues the foe and the fleet coursers might that speeds to ample wealth.
juice that this stone pours out removes defect of ours as in old time it brought prosperity to man.
at sacrifices they established holy rites on tvaṣṭars milkblent juice bright with the hue of steeds.
drive ye the treacherous demons far away from us keep nirrti afar and banish penury.
pour riches forth for us with troops of hero sons and bear ye up o stones the song that visits gods.
to you who are more mighty than the heavens themselves who finishing your task with more than vibhvans speed.
more rapidly than vāyu seize the soma juice better than agni give us food to you i sing.
stirred be the glorious stones let it press out the juice the stone with heavenly song that reaches up to heaven.
there where the men draw forth the meath for which they long sending their voice around in rivalry of speed.
the stones press out the soma swift as carborne men and eager for the spoil drain forth the sap thereof.
to fill the beaker they exhaust the udders store as the men purify oblations with their lips.
ye present men have been most skilful in your work even ye o stones who pressed soma for indras drink.
may all ye have of fair go to the heavenly race and all your treasure to the earthly worshipper.
as with their voice from cloud they sprinkle treasure so are the wise mans liberal sacrifices.
i praise their company that merits worship as the good martits priest to pay them honour.
the youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many nightsthis noble band of maruts.
like stags the sons of dyatis have striven onward the sons of aditi grown strong like pillars.
they who extend beyond the earth and heaven by their own mass as from the cloud spreads sūrya.
like mighty heroes covetous of glory like heavenly gallants who destroy the wicked.
when ye come nigh as in the depth of waters the earth is loosened as it were and shaken.
this your allfeedin sacrifice approaches come all united fraught as twere with viands.
ye are like horses fastened to the chariot poles luminous with your beams with splendour as at dawn.
like selfbright falcons punishers of wicked men like hovering birds urged forward scattering rain around.
when ye come forth o maruts from the distance from the great treasury of rich possessions.
knowing o vasus boons that should be granted even from afar drive back the men who hate us.
he who engaged in the rites final duty brings as a man oblation to the maruts.
wins him lifes wealthy fulness blest with heroes he shall be present too where gods drink soma.
for these are helps adored at sacrifices bringing good fortune by their name Ādityas.
speeding on cars let them protect our praises delighting in our sacrifice and worship.
ye by your hymns are like highthoughted singers skilful inviting gods with sacrifices.
fair to behold like kings with bright adornment like spotless gallants leaders of the people.
like fire with flashing flame breastbound with chains of gold like tempestblasts selfmoving swift to lend your aid.
as best of all foreknowers excellent to guide like somas good to guard the man who follows law.
shakers of all like gales of wind they travel like tongues of burning fires in their effulgence.
mighty are they as warriors clad in armour and like the fathers prayers most bounteous givers.
like spokes of carwheels in one nave united ever victorious like heavenly heroes.
shedding their precious balm like youthful suitors they raise their voice and chant their psalm as singers.
they who are fleet to travel like the noblest steeds long to obtain the prize like bounteous charioteers.
like waters speeding on with their precipitous floods like omniform aṅgirases with sāmahymns.
born from the stream like pressstones are the princes for ever like the stones that crush in pieces.
sons of a beauteous dame like playful children like a great host upon the march with splendour.
like rays of dawn the visitors of sacrifice they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright.
like rivers hasting on glittering with their spears from far away they measure out the distances.
gods send us happiness and make us wealthy letting us singers prosper o ye maruts.
bethink you of our praise and of our friendship ye from of old have riches to vouchsafe us.
i have beheld the might of this great being immortal in the midst of tribes of mortals.
his jaws now open and now shut together much they devour insatiately chewing.
his eyes are turned away his head is hidden unsated with his tongue he eats the fuel.
with hands upraised with reverence in the houses for him they quickly bring his food together.

two perfect springs of heat pervade the threefold and come for their delight is mātariśvan.
craving the milk of heaven the gods are present well do they know the praisesong and the sāman.
the priests beard far away as they are ordered serve the three nirrtis for well they know them.
sages have traced the cause that first produced them dwelling in distant and mysterious chambers.
the youthful one wellshaped with four locks braided brightened with oil puts on the ordinances.
two birds of mighty power are seated near her there where the deities receive their portion.
one of these birds hath passed into the sea of air thence he looks round and views this universal world.
with simple heart i have beheld him from anear his mother kisses him and he returns her kiss.
him with fair wings though only one in nature wise singers shape with songs in many figures.
while they at sacrifices fix the metres they measure out twelve chalices of soma.
while they arrange the four and sixandthirty and duly order up to twelve the measures.
having disposed the sacrifice thoughtful sages send the car forward with the rc and sāman.
the chariots majesties are fourteen others seven sages lead it onward with their voices.
who will declare to us the ford apnana the path whereby they drink first draughts of soma.
the fifteen lauds are in a thousand places that is as vast as heaven and earth in measure.
a thousand spots contain the mighty thousand vāk spreadeth forth as far as prayer extendeth.
what sage hath learned the metres application who hath gained vāk the spirits aim and object.
which ministering priest is called eighth hero who then hath tracked the two bay steeds of indra.
yoked to his chariotpole there stood the coursers they only travel round earths farthest limits.
these when their driver in his home is settled receive the allotted meed of their exertion.
verily wondrous is the tender younglings growth who never draweth nigh to drink his mothers milk.
as soon as she who hath no udder bore him he faring on his great errand suddenly grew strong.
then agni was his name most active to bestow gathering up the trees with his consuming tooth.
skilled in fair sacrifice armed with destroying tongue impetuous as a bull that snorteth in the mead.
praise him yourgod who birdlike rests upon a tree scattering drops of juice and pouring forth his flood.
speaking aloud with flame as with his lips a priest and broadening his paths like one of high command.
thou everlasting whom farstriding fain to burn the winds uninterrupted never overcome.

even thus the gods seem moving round about me the fountains and bestowers of our riches.
the gods have not ordained hunger to be our death even to the wellfed man comes death in varied shape.
the riches of the liberal never waste away while he who will not give finds none to comfort him.
the man with food in store who when the needy comes in miserable case begging for bread to eat.
hardens his heart against himeven when of old he did him servicefinds not one to comfort him.
bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of food and feeble.
success attends him in the shout of battle he makes a friend of him in future troubles.
no friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring food will offer nothing.
let him departno home is that to rest in and rather seek a stranger to support him.
let the rich satisfy the poor implorer and bend his eye upon a longer pathway.
riches come now to one now to another and like the wheels of cars are ever rolling.
the foolish man wins food with fruitless labour that food i speak the truth shall be his ruin.
he feeds no trusty friend no man to love him all guilt is he who eats with no partaker.
the ploughshare ploughing makes the food that feeds us and with its feet cuts through the path it follows.
better the speaking than the silent brahman the liberal friend outyalues him who gives not.
he with one foot hath far outrun the biped and the twofooted catches the threefooted.
fourfooted creatures come when bipeds call them and stand and look where five are met together.
the hands are both alike their labour differs the yield of sister milchkine is unequal.
twins even diffier in their strength and vigour two even kinsmen differ in their bounty.
agni refulgent among men thou slayest the devouring fiend.
